My Smart Garden - Automated growing pot 

My Smart Garden is an automated indoor growing pot, intended to make anybody a better gardener, who has limited access to green space and time to alter the grove pattern. The importance of the engineering proclamation is great responsibility towards the general public, providing a healthier and safer environment to live in. Therefore, in this controlled plant growing station, the automation applies the water to the plant as per a need. The automated watering system operates on computed decisions from precisely obtained data, resulting in an accurate cut-off water point, which makes it a more effective system.  Where in the instance of manual checking, the watering device is incomparable in precision, resulting in reducing the general cost of resources. Unlike conventional outdoor planting depends on favourable weather conditions, the automated growing pot utilises the advantage of technology to maintain the ideal growing environment instead. The study led to the careful selection of sensors to suit technical and ethical concerns to maintain a low impact on to financial and environmental aspects of society.
